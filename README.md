Just started tinkering with Arduino.

For the basics Im following this youtube playlist : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pPexpWW6Hq8&list=PL4B0LEKY-jrT_fjOGkX_NZ52ZHZf8s9S-
Thanks for that Tech at Home.


For the other components, im using blogs and chatGPT. Usually the folder name has the component name used.
